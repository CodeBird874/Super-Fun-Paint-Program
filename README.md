# INTRODUCTION:
Super Fun Paint Program is a web application developed in JavaScript and HTML. It it built using the [p5.js JavaScript library](https://p5js.org/)
It was primarily designed for me to learn how to use JavaScript, but since i thought it was fun to use i have made a website for it.
You can visit the website [here:](https://codebird874.github.io/codebird874.superfunpaintprogram.io/)
